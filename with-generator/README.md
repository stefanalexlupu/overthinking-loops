### [og-for-loop.js](og-for-loop.js)

The original gangster, probably the first one I learnt: the `for` loop. It gives
you full controll on the loop flow, allowing you to break it or skip iterations
using `break` and `continue` respectively.

The fun fact here is that the generator function returns a iterator object,
which can be included in a for-of loop just like that!

### [while-loop.js](while-loop.js)

You get the same degree of controll as for the for loop, but you have to iterate
manually.

### [do-while.js](do-while.js)

Turn the while loop upside down and you get the `do-while` loop.

You should always note that when using this statement, the first iteration
**will** execute, so it would be best to make sure you have everything you need
when entering.

Important when working with iterator objects and do-while loops is to check  the
order in which you call `.next()`, because if you call it twice in a row (like
before entering the loop, and then immediately in the first iteration), you
loose the first value it yields.

You can use `break` and `continue` in a `do-while` loop, but breaking early will
simply do the same check in the loop condition twice. I favour using the
loop condition because you don't step in the next iteration just to find out you
should skip the rest all together, right?

### [recursive.js](recursive.js)

You can totally do this the recursive way if you like, but, it's kinda pointless
and if the basket is large enough, you step into "stack overflow" territory.

### [function.js](function.js)

If you move the loop to a function, you can avoid the `break`ing all together
and return from the function.

### [array-prototype.js](array-prototype.js)

Array prototype methods only work on arrays. That's just common sense, right?

So if you want to use a generator to get an array... you just do this:

```
[...generator()]
```

Remember that the generator function returns an iterator when invoked? You can
acctually use the spread operator to map that to an array.

ðŸ›‘ Make sure you don't do this with a generator that yields an in(de)finite
amount of values. It's like spreading an in(de)finitely sized array, which
smells like trouble if you ask me!
