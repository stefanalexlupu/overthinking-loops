# Overthinking Loops

There's just so many ways to do loops. `for` loops, `while` loops, `recursive`
function calls, and a plethora of `Array.prototype` functions.

In this repo you will find examples of overthinking a stupid simple problem.
If you don't learn anything new, at least have some fun!

## Problem statement

There's a verry hungry caterpillar üêõ sitting in a basket of fruits. As any
other caterpillar would do, he starts eating them.

At some point, he will get full and if attempting to eat more, he will die
(throw an error).

You have to feed the caterpillar fruits from the basket, and make sure not to
let him eat to much!

PS: The caterpillar is picky and doesn't like üçà.

## Solutions

Most of the time, we use loops when working with arrays. But iteration doesn't
have to be restricted to arrays: you can iterate on iterator objects, which you
can create with a generator function.

I bet that there are plenty more ways to overthink loops, but for now in this
repository we will play with these two:

- [array](with-array)
- [generator function](with-generator)

You can find each in its folder ‚ú®
